    <p>The ancient Americans have enjoyed the classic taste of Chipotle Mexican Grill since the early 1990s. Many of our ancestors traveled far in their light blue Honda Civic Hatchback sometimes upwards to 12 miles to their local Chipotle to taste of its fares. The classic burrito comes wrapped in an oversized tortilla that will break apart upon partaking. It is imperative that one gets the guac, as it is mother nature's nectar of the Gods. Now, in the 21st century, ever since Bill Gates invented the internet, one can order Chipotle on their cellphone using nanotechnology and it can be delivered to you or you can pick it up at one of the 3 locations near you.</p>
