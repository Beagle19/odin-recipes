    <h2>Typical Neopolitan pizza, roundish in shape.</h2>
    <p>Pizza Margherita is a Neopolitan pizza garnished with hand-crushed peeled tomatoes, mozzarella, fresh basil leaves, and extra virgin olive oil. The dough is stretched by the <em>pizzaiolo</em> and baked in an oven, which is traditionally made of brick and wood-fired. This pizza is exquisite due to it's complete simplicity and the freshest, most basic of ingredients. It is the physical manifestation of the phrase: "Keep it simple, silly".</p>
