    <h2>Fertilized egg commonly sold as street food in the Philippines</h2>
    <p>A balut is a fertilized bird egg, usually duck, which is incubated for a period of 14 to 21 days and then steamed. The contents are eaten directly from the shell. The partially developed embryo bones are soft enough to chew and swallow as a whole. A combination of savory, gamey and rich characterisitics can be found in the flavor which makes it an acquired taste that many Philipinos treasure as a culinary treat and a part of their culture.</p>
